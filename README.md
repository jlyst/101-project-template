# [Fast Park]

[When you're running late for school and don't have time to look for a park, use the application and it'll lead you righ to an open spot.]

[When you log on the application, you select your parking carage, select the kind of vehicle your have. 
Then, you select a preferred garage level. If there's spots available on that level, you'll be led to a park. 
If there's no spots on that level, you'll be directed to the closest park to the level you chose.]
